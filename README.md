# ASN Label Generator

A **web-based tool** for generating PDF sheets of labels with ASN (Archive Serial Number) numbers and corresponding QR codes, designed to work with the paperless-ngx document management system.
This tool helps you create labels that can be attached to physical documents before scanning, allowing paperless-ngx to automatically assign unique identifiers to your scanned documents.

**üåê Try it now at [eikowagenknecht.com/asn-label-generator/](https://eikowagenknecht.com/asn-label-generator/)** - No installation required, works directly in your browser!

## What it's used for

When you scan a document with a label generated by this tool, paperless-ngx will read the QR code and use the ASN number as the document's identifier.
This creates a reliable link between your physical and digital documents, making it easier to:

- Track the relationship between physical and digital documents
- Quickly locate physical documents when needed
- Maintain a consistent naming scheme across your document management system
- Automate document processing workflows in paperless-ngx

The generated labels include both human-readable ASN numbers and QR codes.

## üåê Web Application

The easiest way to use this tool is through the web interface - no installation required!

### Live Application
**[Use the web version at eikowagenknecht.com/asn-label-generator](https://eikowagenknecht.com/asn-label-generator/)**

### Key Features

- **Flexible quantity control** - Generate exact number of labels or full pages (189 labels per A4 sheet)
- **Customizable ASN numbering** - Configure starting number, digit length, and prefixes
- **Skip labels** - Resume printing on partially used sheets
- **Printer alignment tools** - X/Y offsets, scaling, and debug borders for precise alignment
- **Content spacing control** - Adjust margins between QR codes and text
- **Real-time preview** - Live summary showing label count and ASN range
- **Progress tracking** - Visual indicator during PDF generation
- **Privacy-friendly** - All processing happens in your browser, no data sent to servers
- **Mobile-friendly** - Responsive interface for any device

### Quick Start
1. Visit [eikowagenknecht.com/asn-label-generator/](https://eikowagenknecht.com/asn-label-generator/)
2. Configure your labels using the intuitive form
3. Click "Generate Labels" to download your PDF
4. Print on Avery L4731 compatible label sheets

## Alternative: Command Line Interface

While the web application is the easiest way to use this tool, a CLI version is also available for power users and automation scenarios.

üìã **[View CLI Documentation ‚Üí](README.cli.md)**

The CLI provides all the same features as the web version, plus additional options for automation and scripting.

## Label Format Support

Currently supports Avery L4731 labels with the following specifications:

- 7 columns √ó 27 rows on A4 paper
- Label size: 25.4mm √ó 10mm
- Gutter size: 2.5mm horizontal, 0mm vertical
- Page margins: 13.5mm top, 9mm left

These labels are chosen for their optimal size for document management - large enough to be easily readable but small enough to not obscure important document content.

**Need support for a different label format?** Please [open an issue](https://github.com/eikowagenknecht/asn-label-generator/issues) with the label specifications and I'll implement it for you.
